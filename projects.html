            <h2>Minecraft Indev+</h2>

            <p>Indev+ is a complete overhaul mod for Minecraft Indev, which aims to take an old 2010 version of the game and shape it into something entirely new and unique.</p>
            <p>The mod contains a plethora of new features and mechanics, which help add a consistent progression system into the game, whilst simultaneously keeping the finite worlds philosophy of the original.</p>
            <p>Some unique elements of the mod include, but are not limited to: Seasons, complex character system, world hopping using portals, end-game items (charms), blood moon mechanic, new world types, boss mobs and much more.</p>
            <p>Latest version of the mod can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/186Fy_923ufluJ0knQzMQs9bWBB84c4c8/view?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

            <h2>Minecraft Classic+</h2>

            <p>Classic+ is a complete overhaul mod for Minecraft Classic version 0.30, which adds a plethora of new, original content to the game, whilst keeping the look and feel of the original version.</p>
            <p>Some of the more notable additions include, but are not limited to: World types and themes, new "arcade" gamemode, powerups and unique crafting systems, single-player commands, survival inventory, armor and much more.</p>
            <p>The mod also supports a fully functioning survival multiplayer, something the original game was lacking. This was made by repurposing the little existing MP code and writing a new netcode specifically designed to support the survival elements of the game.</p>
            <p>This project was what got me into Java programming, as my only prior experience has been minor code edits and making small programs using Processing. About 55% of the game's original code has been rewritten, and a lot of new code has been added.</p>
            <p>Latest version of the mod can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mckSEtd7H4J84955mnr7qzi0Aub-NqbF/view?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

            <h2>World of Padman 1.6.2 Fan Trailer</h2>

            <p>A fan trailer for World of Padman, an indie freeware fun shooter, designed to promote this relatively obscure title.</p>
            <p>I did not make the game or contribute to its initial development, but I have made some mods and ports for it in the past.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Learned how to use DaVinci Resolve to produce the trailer.</li>

            <h2>Nitronic Rush Custom Level - CORE Filtration</h2>

            <p>Some of my earliest experience with level design, CORE Filtration is the second level I made for the free survival racing game "Nitronic Rush". It was made using the game's built-in level editor in the span of several days, and it is more well received than my previous level, often denoted as the hardest level ever made for the game.</p>
            <p>To the left is a full run of the level from a speedrunner of the game. It is 11 floors, each with obstacles of progressively increasing difficulty. The level is a "challenge" level, meaning if you die, you get sent back to the very beginning.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>First experience with level design in any game.</li>
                <li>Positive feedback from the community.</li>
                <li>Unique, never tried in the game before concept.</li>

            <h2>RubyRevived - Minecraft Pre-Classic mod</h2>

            <p>RubyRevived is a mod for Minecraft Pre-Classic which I briefly collaborated on. The mod aims at recreating the lost game "RubyDung", which served as some of Minecraft's inspiration and early code-base. I helped with getting block color offsets working, as well as fixing some menu and world loading bugs.</p>
            <p>The project is currently on hiatus, but I am still a member of the development team.</p>

        <h2>World of Padman mod ports and fixes</h2>

        <p>A collection of ports and fixes for an older version of a free indie shooter titled "World of Padman". I worked on porting a mod for a newer version (1.5) to an older one (1.2), fixing some bot scripts and re-creating a missing character model in Blender, as well as some weapon skins made in GIMP.</p>
