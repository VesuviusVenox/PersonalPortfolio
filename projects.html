            <h2>Minecraft Recreation Project</h2>

            <p>A project aimed at recreating every individual missing version of Minecraft with extreme accuracy.</p>
            <p>Over the span of two years (from September 2019 until June 2021) I have managed to successfully recreate 151 missing versions of the game Minecraft, all coded in Java using LWJGL and by modifying the source of existing versions.</p>
            <p>This project was my introduction to Java, and helped me improve my programming skills along the way.</p>
            <p>To the is an image of one of 10 builds labeled "0.24", all of which took 2 days to make.</p>
            <p>A full spreadsheet of all the different recreations and an overview of how each one was made can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q8isIspOiCgISfuuT7FtvtAVDdx9Whvn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109863346643452877534&rtpof=true&sd=true">here</a>.</p>

            <p>A fan trailer for World of Padman, an indie freeware fun shooter, designed to promote this relatively obscure title.</p>
            <p>I did not make the game or contribute to its initial development, but I have made some mods and ports for it in the past.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <h2>Pokemon Crimson</h2>

            <p>My first attempt at a video game. The project began in early concepting stages as early as 2016, where I wanted to make my own Pokemon video game with an aging and maturing protagonist, set in a darker, more realistic version of the Kanto region.</p>
            <p>I also had game mechanic ideas, such as a new type: Light, as well as a bunch of new moves and other gameplay elements.</p>
            <p>To the left is a short video demo of an older version of the project, showing off the starter house. The current version has the entirety of Pallet Town finished, the new light type and some new moves and a sprite for the main character. I went for high amounts of detail with the level design.</p>
            <p>The game is made in RPG Maker using Pokemon Assets from the third generation of games for the GameBoy Advance.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Learned how to use PRG Maker and basic scripting in Ruby.</li>
                <li>Learned how to use GIMP for sprite editing.</li>
                <li>Entry point for my study at Saxion; was tasked to create a simple game using any tools of my liking. Ended up showing the later version of the demo during the intake.</li>

            <h2>Nitronic Rush Custom Level - CORE Filtration</h2>

            <p>Some of my earliest experience with level design, CORE Filtration is the second level I made for the free survival racing game "Nitronic Rush". It was made using the game's built-in level editor in the span of several days, and it is more well received than my previous level, often denoted as the hardest level ever made for the game.</p>
            <p>To the left is a full run of the level from a speedrunner of the game. It is 11 floors, each with obstacles of progressively increasing difficulty. The level is a "challenge" level, meaning if you die, you get sent back to the very beginning.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>First experience with level design in any game.</li>
                <li>Positive feedback from the community.</li>
                <li>Unique, never tried in the game before concept.</li>

            <h2>RubyRevived - Minecraft Pre-Classic mod</h2>

            <p>RubyRevived is a mod for Minecraft Pre-Classic which I briefly collaborated on. The mod aims at recreating the lost game "RubyDung", which served as some of Minecraft's inspiration and early code-base. I helped with getting block color offsets working, as well as fixing some menu and world loading bugs.</p>
            <p>The project is currently on hiatus, but I am still a member of the development team.</p>

        <p>A collection of ports and fixes for an older version of a free indie shooter titled "World of Padman". I worked on porting a mod for a newer version (1.5) to an older one (1.2), fixing some bot scripts and re-creating a missing character model in Blender, as well as some weapon skins made in GIMP.</p>
