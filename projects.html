            <h2>Minecraft Recreation Project</h2>

            <p>A project aimed at recreating every individual missing version of Minecraft with extreme accuracy.</p>
            <p>Over the span of two years (from September 2019 until June 2021) I have managed to successfully recreate over 100 missing versions of the game Minecraft, all coded in Java using LWJGL and by modifying the source of existing versions.</p>
            <p>This project was my introduction to Java, and helped me improve my programming skills along the way.</p>
            <p>To the left you can see an image of one of 10 builds labeled "0.24", all 10 of which took 2 days to make.</p>

            <h2>Notable takeaways:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Learned the basics and Java and LWJGL by modifying existing game code.</li>
                <li>Learned how to use the Eclipse IDE and an array of bytecode editors</li>
                <li>Lots of dedication</li>
            </ul>
