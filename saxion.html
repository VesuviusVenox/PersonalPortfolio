            <h2>SpaceBound</h2>

            <p>A mobile arcade game with roguelite elements, designed for quick bursts of gameplay during mundane tasks. Made in Unity.</p>
            <p>I worked on the trailer, sound design and market research.</p>
            <p>None of the art, assets or music are produced by me. Some of the in-game sounds and music tracks were edited by me, however, in order to fit the style of the game better.</p>
            <p>Game can be downloaded <a href = "https://jenoah.itch.io/spacebound" target = "_blank">here</a></p>

            <h2>Crowscape</h2>

            <p>A point-and-click puzzle game made as a group project for a university assignment. The game is programmed in Processing, a Java-based language.</p>
            <p>My main role in the project was a an engineer, and along with the other engineer in the team, we programmed the menus and puzzles with a given, basic engine.</p>
            <p>About half of the puzzles in the game are programmed by me. I was also a pseudo-designer and helped with designing some of the puzzles and establishing the main tone of the game.</p>
            <p>None of the art, assets or music are produced by me.</p>
            <p>Game can be downloaded <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1So0X3qAYoaRsqWdFzjZpDXCi705u1aCl/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a></p>

            <h2>Crypt of Ammon</h2>

            <p>Another group project game I collaborated on. This game is a physics-based puzzle game where the player must push boxes with a magical staff to certain pressure plates in order to progress.</p>
            <p>For this project, I was primarily responsible for the website shown in <a href = "websites.html" class = "sites">websites</a>, as well as the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwYWRfqOMOPim6nnR5LKB5W3YJz7qPwf/view?usp=sharing">infographic</a>, the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sln10Rp8CJJXUXO682fd3jxWDCV4PAaD/view?usp=sharing">controller schematic</a> and a <a href = "https://flowlab.io/game/play/1704639">basic physics prototype designed in flowlab.</a></p>
            <p>Art, assets, soundtrack and coding was done by the others in my team.</p>
            <p>Game can be found <a href = "https://liamvanasten.itch.io/crypt-of-ammon" target = "_blank">here</a></p>

            <h2>Bullrush</h2>

            <p>Group project arcade game, where you guide a bull to break objects in a large arena for points.</p>
            <p>In this project, I was responsible for the core mechanics of the game, as well as the level design.</p>
            <p>Code and assets made by other team members.</p>

            <h2>Ruler of the Depths</h2>

            <p>A physical board game designed in a group.</p>
            <p>I am partially responsible for some of the gameplay mechanics, balancing and editing the gameplay trailer.</p>
            <p>The voice-over in the trailer is not recorded by me, and neither is the footage of the board game. Effects and editing were done in Davinci Resolve, and it was my first experience with the program.</p>
