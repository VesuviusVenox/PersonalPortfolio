            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>Greetings, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Yoan Nikolov and I am an aspiring web and UI designer. I am currently studying Creative Media and Game Technologies at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I have designed several websites throughout my studies using HTML and CSS, and a couple beforehand, using online building tools, with a strong emphasis on an intuitive and fluid UI. All of them can be found under the websites tab. Apart from website building, I also have a talent in creative writing.</p>
            <p>I have experience with working in Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Unity, Davinci Resolve, GIMP, Audacity and I know the basics of Java, C# and VBA, in addition to my HTML and CSS knowledge. In my free time, I like to explore the world and travel to new places, read books or play and modify video games.</p>
            <p>If You are curious to find out more, you can go through all of the things I have made, or contact me directly. Enjoy your stay!</p>
