            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>Greetings, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Yoan Nikolov and I am an aspiring 26 year old game, web and UI designer. I am a recent graduate from the Creative Media and Game Technologies at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I have designed several games and website designs throughout my studies, with a strong emphasis on an intuitive and fluid UI. The games were developed in group projects, where my role was designing core gameplay mechanics, documentation, play-testing, level design, UI design and promotion. All of them can be found under the websites and Saxion projects tabs. Apart from website building, I also have a talent in creative writing.</p>
            <p>I have experience with working in Visual Studio Code, Eclipse IDE, Davinci Resolve, GIMP, Audacity and I know HTML, CSS, VBA and the basics of Java. In my free time, I like to explore the world and travel to new places, read books or play and modify video games.</p>
            <p>If You are curious to find out more, you can go through all of the things I have made, or contact me directly. Enjoy your stay!</p>
